Dear Professor,
link: https://nurlan985.github.io/W3D2-maze.html

I did this assignment on class It was easy.

In additional I created function gameOver, youWin, start, and writeStatus.

I used click, mouseover, mouseleave, addClass, removeClass functions for doing this assignment.
    mouseover, mouseleave for catch lost or win.
    click for start game.
    addClass, removeClass for restart/lost game.

I did mouseover for class ".boundary" and it will call gameOver();
And I did mouseleave for div with Id="maze" and it also call gameOver(); It's if palyer want cheating.

This assignment refreshed my knowledge about jQuery.

This assignment took about 1 hour.


Thanks,

Best regards,
Nurlan Kustutinov

    The object of this game is to guide the mouse cursor through the start area and get to the end area.  Be sure to avoid the walls:
