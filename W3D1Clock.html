Dear Professor,

This is my Link:

Part 1: https://nurlan985.github.io/W3D1Clock.html

Part 2: https://nurlan985.github.io/W3D1Account.html


I did first part around 30 minutes.

there is I used .bind for function render because when run this function from setInterval, there is different context. so we should give this context by bind (or did this function by arrow function). render use some staff from this context.

        It was very interesting, I learned a lot about javascript class.

It is very informative.

Second part I did around 2 hour. 

It was easy, but it took some time.  

It was very good practices for my new knowledge.

I did data structures in JavaScript it is very interesting. It is good think. Before I worked a lot with data structure in C#.

For close account I used splice, for add I used push.

In Exercise e, I used account.constructor.name for show which account is showing from array in bank.

Thanks,

Best regards,
Nurlan Kustutinov
