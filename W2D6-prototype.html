Dear Professor,

This is my Link: https://nurlan985.github.io/W2D6-prototype.html



I did first part around 30 minutes. (for first part I attached file)

It was very interesting, I learned a lot about ptototype. Now I know how I can do function for All strings. For example function for all strings EqualIgnoreCase();

It is very informative.


Second part I did around 1 hour.


It is very good practies for my new knowledge.

For first exercise I did new function for String.prototype. And in this function I used split(" "). And find banned words.

second exercise was looks like first. I did function sort for Array object.

And last exercise It was easy. Teacher's function teach looks like student's function learn.

thanks for exercise like this.



Best regards,
Nurlan Kustutinov
